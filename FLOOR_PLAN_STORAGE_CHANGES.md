# Floor Plan Storage Changes

## Overview
This document outlines the modifications made to the Next.js application to remove floor plan detection functionality and implement local session storage with a 1-hour expiration mechanism.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Functions and Dependencies

The following functions were completely removed from `src/app/page.tsx`:
- `detectFloorPlanFeatures()`
- `detectArchitecturalEdges()`
- `detectArchitecturalLines()`
- `detectRectangularShapes()`
- `analyzeContrastPatterns()`
- `detectOuterBorders()`
- `detectTextRegions()`
- `verifyFloorPlan()`

### 2. Removed Dependencies
- `@tensorflow/tfjs` import (TensorFlow.js library)
- `apiService` import (backend API service)

### 3. Modified Form Submission Logic

**Before:**
- Image was analyzed using TensorFlow.js for floor plan detection
- Valid images were uploaded to backend via `apiService.floorplan.uploadFloorplan()`
- Invalid images showed detailed error messages

**After:**
- Image is directly processed and stored locally
- No backend upload occurs
- No validation/analysis is performed
- Direct navigation to `/crop` page after successful processing

### 4. Enhanced Session Storage

Updated `src/utils/sessionStorage.ts` with the following improvements:

#### New Features:
- **1-Hour Expiration**: Sessions now expire after exactly 1 hour (60 minutes)
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired sessions are automatically cleared
- **Expiration Tracking**: Added `expiresAt` field to metadata
- **Time Remaining**: New method to check remaining session time
- **Session Extension**: Ability to extend session expiration

#### Key Methods:
```typescript
// Store image with 1-hour expiration
storeOriginalFloorPlan(file: File, analysisId: string, blobUrl: string)

// Check if session is expired
isSessionExpired(sessionData?: FloorPlanSessionData): boolean

// Get remaining time in minutes
getTimeRemaining(): number

// Extend session by 1 hour
extendSession(): boolean
```

## Image Storage Mechanism

### How Images Are Stored

1. **File Processing**: 
   - User uploads image file
   - File is read using FileReader API
   - Blob URL is created for efficient memory access

2. **Session Storage**:
   - Image data stored in browser's sessionStorage
   - Includes original file, blob URL, and metadata
   - Unique session ID generated for each upload

3. **Data Structure**:
```typescript
{
  sessionId: string,
  originalImage: {
    blobUrl: string,
    file: File,
    analysisId: string
  },
  metadata: {
    uploadedAt: string,
    lastModified: string,
    expiresAt: string  // 1 hour from upload
  }
}
```

### 1-Hour Expiration Mechanism

1. **Expiration Calculation**:
   ```typescript
   const expiresAt = new Date(now.getTime() + 60 * 60 * 1000); // 1 hour
   ```

2. **Automatic Validation**:
   - Every session access checks expiration
   - Expired sessions are automatically cleared
   - Memory is freed by revoking blob URLs

3. **Cleanup Process**:
   - Blob URLs are revoked to prevent memory leaks
   - Session data is removed from storage
   - User is redirected to upload page if session expires

## Security and Efficiency

### Security Features:
- **Local Storage Only**: No data sent to external servers
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Prevents data accumulation
- **Memory Management**: Blob URLs are properly revoked
- **Session Isolation**: Each session has unique ID

### Efficiency Features:
- **Blob URLs**: Efficient image access without base64 encoding
- **Lazy Loading**: Images loaded only when needed
- **Memory Cleanup**: Automatic garbage collection
- **Minimal Processing**: No heavy image analysis

## User Experience

### Before Changes:
- Users experienced delays during image analysis
- Complex error messages for invalid floor plans
- Dependency on backend server availability
- Potential privacy concerns with image upload

### After Changes:
- Instant image processing
- No validation errors (accepts any image)
- Works offline (no backend dependency)
- Enhanced privacy (local storage only)
- Seamless navigation to crop page

## Technical Implementation

### File Size Limits:
- Maximum file size: 10MB
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG
- Client-side validation maintained

### Error Handling:
- File reading errors
- File size validation
- Storage quota exceeded
- Browser compatibility issues

### Browser Compatibility:
- Uses standard Web APIs (FileReader, sessionStorage)
- Works in all modern browsers
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

## Migration Notes

### For Developers:
- No changes needed to other components
- Session storage API remains the same
- Crop page functionality unchanged
- All UI components preserved

### For Users:
- Faster upload process
- No analysis delays
- Same workflow (upload → crop → analysis)
- Better privacy protection

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements:
- Add image compression for large files
- Implement progressive image loading
- Add session recovery mechanisms
- Consider localStorage for longer persistence

### Monitoring:
- Track session expiration rates
- Monitor storage usage
- Analyze user behavior patterns
- Performance metrics collection
